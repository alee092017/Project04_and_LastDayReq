##MVP: 
  - Instant Schadenfreude--It’s basically a shortcut to stupid gifs of people tripping, falling, getting hit in their junk or face, etc;  
        - the api call to giphy will be taken from a set list provided to the user like walking, running, cycling, pro sports, and the search automatically add fail to the search.  
        - so if someone clicks on ‘pro sports’ the api call that goes to giphy is pro sports fail.  
        - it will maybe (or not) have auth which i hope will fulfill the full crud requirement, user will be able to save favorites or a list and that will display for them.
  - User can create, edit, delete account, and save favorites to profile (honestly I'd like your feedback on auth.  it feels like a January augemnetation at this point)
  - Display all gifs
  - Edit the description of a gif
  - Favorite a gif
  - Add a gif
  - Delete a gif
  - Add comment for a gif
  - Search for gifs
  - 
##Reach Goals:
  - auth?  
  -  I'll be honest with you, given my performance over the last 3 projects the whole thing seems like a reach goal.  I'd like to deploy
##User Stories & Wire Frames:
  - home page-
      - display all categories (this will be a short list of categories that live on this page)
   - user can click on a category to display a short list of gifs
   - user can then favorite, add (?!)

##Planned Technologies:
  - Will build this on Rails
  - Use giphy API--there is also this which I may spend a few hours exploring this [ruby gem](https://github.com/sebasoga/giphy)--but it seems like it might be unnecessary.
##Timelines:
    [Pls see my project page](https://github.com/alee092017/Project04_and_LastDayReq/projects/1)
##Foreseen challenges or obstacles:
    - the V of MVC.  creating views always trips me up more so than anything else.
    - All of Auth
